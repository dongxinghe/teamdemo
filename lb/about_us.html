				Today Andrey Sokruta Interior Design Studio successfully applies the strongest wishes of our clients to reality. Good responses
				of our clients and their happy smiles are the best proof for it. If you face the choice of a team to trust your new interior
				design, we are glad to offer out services
			</p>
			<p>My artistic life started in the kinder garden, where on the classes of plasticine modeling and drawing my works turned
				out to be much better than the others’. Back then I did not know, that I did it good, but I definitely was satisfied
				by the process itself.

				Later, in school, I attended drawing classes and in seventh form I entered an artistic school. The teachers of art usually
				praised me and showed my works to the class. At that moment I had already realized, that I definitely am a creative person.
				And of course, when I was to choose the higher education institution, there could be no doubts – my choice was directly
				connected to art. In Sumy Dmitry Bortniansky High School of Art and Culture there passed four years of my life, which
				turned out to be most interesting and filled with art. In School we were learned the following classes: painting, drawing,
				sculpture, ceramics, composition, design. This very period became significant in forming my aesthetic acceptance of the
				world surrounding me.
			</p>
			<p>
				I remember, that this was the time I felt passionate about interior design. And that is why my next step became Kharkov State
				Academy of Design and Arts. Here I learnt the bases of interior design and became sure, this was my path.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the years of studying and self-improving in schools and higher education institutions the time has come to start practicing.
				And in 2008, I successfully fulfilled my first real project.

							Our destinctive feature is attention to the little things. There can be no design without details. Imagine, for example,
							the kitchen’s interior without kitchenware, dishes, cooker hood and wall clock. In order to percieve the project completely,
							we need all the elements, planned to be placed there, to be included into the project. This is why being an inveterate
							perfectionist I cultivate the importance of the little things among the studio staff.

							The main criterium for a successful design is the comfortability of using it. Yes, the client first pays attention to the
							aesthetics of the project, and can estimate how comfortable the solution is only after its realization. Our task is
							to provide you with the best combination of a beautiful shell and the functuality, as a beautiful execution without
							coziness of using is pointless.
