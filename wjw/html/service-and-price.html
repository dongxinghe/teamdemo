									Since 2008, Andrey Sokruta's founding studio has been working on room design. Over the years, we have also provided services to create the necessary technical documentation during the execution of a design project. The service includes preparation of technical tasks and measurement drawings that take into account room engineering communications.

									The technical documentation provided by our company, this list includes all the materials, the choice of floor and ceiling coverings necessary for the curved wall, the lighting component plan, and links it to the power supply, the location of the furniture and sanitary ware, and all the necessary Details.

									Visual perception of the project is necessary to fully understand it. In order to give customers a chance to fully consider the proposed variant, we are developing a 3Ds-MAX model. This is a three-dimensional version of the actual size project image that best demonstrates the client's design solution.

							<div class="ins-text">

									The advantage of a 3D layout is the ability to view the room from any desired angle. Therefore, you can create an “existing effect” and evaluate the aesthetic and practical attributes of the proposed design. With the help of visual models, customers can not only see large internal elements, but also view the smallest details.

									The convenience of working with us is also that all costs associated with the project are recorded in the statements we provide to each customer.

							<div class="ins-text">
								<span>
									All fees are agreed in advance by the customer. During the introductory meeting, the designer and client will outline the approximate budget of the project and we will take action there. Since each project is unique, costs are also calculated separately. For example, even the cost of the floor depends on the material, size and manufacturer.

									The form provided to the customer takes into account all the parameters of the design element: size, color, manufacturer, markup and value. The communication location within the room plays an important role in the creation of the project.
